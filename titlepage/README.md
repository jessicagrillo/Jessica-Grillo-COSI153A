TITLE: Adopt-A-Doxie

ELEVATOR PITCH: This app is designed for you to view a dachshund who needs a home, read the dachshund's story, and name the dachshund (naming the dog will help you make a connection with it and see if the feeling you have tells you to adopt it!). If you want to keep searching for the perfect match, you can click the button to see the next doxie who needs a home. This app helps find displaced dachshunds a safe and loving home, and this app helps you grow your family with a loyal companion!
